    <h3>Random and Server Pushes</h3>
    <p>Upon load, the client requests one immediate random fortune from the server which it uses to initially populate the view. The client also instructs the server to send random fortunes at specified intervals. These server communications are specific to each client.</p>

    <p>When the server pushes a new fortune, Chaplin's CollectionView, View, Collection, and Model classes are used to render the fortune to the screen. The collection uses the 'add' event to prune the collection to a specific number of fortunes.</p>
